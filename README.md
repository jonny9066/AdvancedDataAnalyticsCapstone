# Advanced Data Analytics Capstone
### Overview
In this project, we were taksed with analyzing why an employee may be likely to leave the company in order to understand how to retain employees better. We were given a dataset with fields such as _tenure_, _satisfaction level_, and _salary_, and the label: whether an employee left the comapny or not. We used the PACE strategy to approach this task in a logical and structured manner. When analyzing the data, we used the principles of EDA. Finally, we constructed a random forest model to predict whether an employee would eave the company or not, getting an accuracy of 0.958.

### Tools used
* Pandas for working with datasets.
* Saeborn and Pyplot for plotting the data.
* Scikit-learn to prepare the data for training and for constructing a machine learning model.
